                      the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.  The arbitration shall be
                      conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator.  Any claims or
                      disputes where the total amount of the award sought is
                      less than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be
                      resolved through binding non-appearance-based arbitration,
                      at the option of the party seeking relief.  For claims or
                      disputes where the total amount of the award sought is Ten
                      Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) or more, the right
                      to a hearing will be determined by the Arbitration Rules. 
                      Any hearing will be held in a location within 100 miles of
                      your residence, unless you reside outside of the United
                      States, and unless the parties agree otherwise.  If you
                      reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator shall give the
                      parties reasonable notice of the date, time and place of
                      any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered by
                      the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                      jurisdiction.  If the arbitrator grants you an award that
                      is greater than the last settlement offer that the Company
                      made to you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the
                      Company will pay you the greater of the award or
                      $2,500.00.  Each party shall bear its own costs and
                      disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay
                      an equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.

                        Arbitration.</strong
                      >
                      If non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the
                      arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or
                      based solely on written submissions; the specific manner
                      shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. 
                      The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance
                      by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise agreed by the
                      parties.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Time Limits.</strong> If you or the Company
                      pursues arbitration, the arbitration action must be
                      initiated and/or demanded within the statute of
                      limitations and within any deadline imposed under the AAA
                      Rules for the pertinent claim.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      <strong>Authority of Arbitrator.</strong> If arbitration
                      is initiated, the arbitrator will decide the rights and
                      liabilities of you and the Company, and the dispute will
                      not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with
                      any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the
                      authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of
                      any claim.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to
                      award monetary damages, and to grant any non-monetary
                      remedy or relief available to an individual under
                      applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms.  The
                      arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of
                      decision describing the essential findings and conclusions
                      on which the award is based.  The arbitrator has the same
                      authority to award relief on an individual basis that a
                      judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the
                      arbitrator is final and binding upon you and the Company.

                      <strong>Waiver of Jury Trial.</strong> THE PARTIES HEREBY
                      WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO
                      COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY,
                      instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be
                      resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. 
                      Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more
                      efficient and less expensive than rules applicable in a
                      court and are subject to very limited review by a court. 
                      In the event any litigation should arise between you and
                      the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to
                      vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU
                      AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead
                      electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions.</strong>
                      All claims and disputes within the scope of this
                      arbitration agreement must be arbitrated or litigated on
                      an individual basis and not on a class basis, and claims
                      of more than one customer or user cannot be arbitrated or
                      litigated jointly or consolidated with those of any other
                      customer or user.

                      The parties agree to maintain confidentiality unless
                      otherwise required by law.  This paragraph shall not
                      prevent a party from submitting to a court of law any
                      information necessary to enforce this Agreement, to
                      enforce an arbitration award, or to seek injunctive or
                      equitable relief.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part or parts of
                      this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be
                      invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
                      jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of
                      no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder
                      of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Right to Waive.</strong> Any or all of the rights
                      and limitations set forth in this Arbitration Agreement
                      may be waived by the party against whom the claim is
                      asserted.  Such waiver shall not waive or affect any other
                      portion of this Arbitration Agreement.

                      individual action in small claims court.

                    <p>
                      <strong>Emergency Equitable Relief.</strong> Anyhow the
                      foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable
                      relief before a state or federal court in order to
                      maintain the status quo pending arbitration.  A request
                      for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any
                      other rights or obligations under this Arbitration
                      Agreement.
